## What do we bring
- IBM Cloud ressources
- Watsonx platform (with LLM capabilities) 
- IBM Research Asset: Deep Search

IBM watsonx™ AI and data platform includes three core components and a set of AI assistants designed to help you scale and accelerate the impact of AI with trusted data across your business.
The core components include: a studio for new foundation models, generative AI and machine learning; a fit-for-purpose data store built on an open data lakehouse architecture; and a toolkit, to accelerate AI workflows that are built with responsibility, transparency and explainability. 

## Sample Scenarios 
### Provided Hack Challenges 
#### 1. Master the Daily Chaos turn any document overflow into ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS!

Digital.industry: AI Data Synthesis from Vast Document Realms Catalog and retrieve information from large set of unstructured documents.

   ##### User Story:
   As a working professional (of any domain), I want to retrieve specific information from a large number of unstructured company information/data sheets/ESG reports using natural language, without the risk of misrepresented data. So
   that I can make informed decisions quickly, based on large volumes of data.

   ##### Example Scenarios:
   Every organization is built on documents, from legal briefs, financial statements, and technical specifications, to research papers and slide decks. These documents are packed with valuable information, but their contents are often not easy to search because they’re in an unstructured format that can’t be accessed easily.

   Let’s change that! Make information seamlessly discoverable with state-of-the-art AI methods.

#### 2. Enjoy the ride with CONTEXT-BASED INFORMATION on the go!

Context-aware passenger augmentation. Enhance the driving experience by including context-aware information.

   ##### User Story:
   As a driver, passenger, or commuter I want my vehicle to incorporate information about the surroundings and context to interact with me to have a more personal, interesting, and enjoyable experience on my journey.

   ##### Example Scenario:
   Create a delightful experience: Use AI/LLM to generate game-show-style questions from Wikipedia information about the surroundings for in-car entertainment.
