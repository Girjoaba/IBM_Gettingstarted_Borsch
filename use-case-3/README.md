## Project overview
### User Story:
As a manager or maintainer of a complex array of infrastructure components in the industrial environment, having a single source of truth for what is in the environment becomes critical.
Using the GitOps approach, create deployment chains for the infrastructure and workload components

### Example Scenarios:
On the factory floor workloads can vary from PLCs to HMIs, a variety of IoT sensors and data collection points, and even computer vision nodes used for visual inspection.
Let's build a platform that can manage and deploy to the device of choice, wheter it be an inferencing node or a controller.
