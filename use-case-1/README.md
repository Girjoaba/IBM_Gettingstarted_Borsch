Digital.industry: AI Data Synthesis from Vast Document Realms Catalog and retrieve information from large set of unstructured documents.
## Project overview
### User Story:
As a work professional (of any domain), I want to retrieve specific information from a large number of unstructured company information/data sheets/ESG reports using natural language, without the risk of misrepresented data. So that I can make informed decision quickly, based on large volumes of data.

### Example Scenarios:
Every organization is built on documents, from legal briefs, financial statements, and technical specifications, to research papers, and slide decks. These documents are packed with valuable information, but their contents are often not easy to search, because they’re in an unstructured format that can’t be accessed easily.

Let’s change that! Make information seamlessly discoverable with state-of-the-art AI methods.
