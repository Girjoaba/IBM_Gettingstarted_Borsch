Improving the driving experience with context-aware information can make journeys more personalized, engaging, and enjoyable for everyone in the car. This use case aims to use advanced technology to include real-time, context-based information in the vehicle's infotainment system. This provides an interactive and informative experience for passengers and drivers alike.

## Project Overview
### User Story:
As a driver, passenger, or commuter I want my vehicle to incorporate information about the surroundings and context to interact with me to have a more personal, interesting, and enjoyable experience on my journey.

### Example Scenario:
   Create a delightful experience: Use AI/LLM to generate game-show-style questions from Wikipedia information about the surroundings for in-car entertainment.
